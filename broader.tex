\section{Broader Impacts}
\label{sec:broader}

The proposed research is expected to have important impacts on the built environment.
According to the EPA, buildings are responsible for producing 6\% of
greenhouse gasses and heat and electrical generation produces another
25\%\footnote{\url{https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data}}.
A large portion of the electrical consumption in buildings is used for
heating, cooling and artificial lighting. Our proposal addresses the
reduction of electricity for artificial lighting to be replaced by
reflected daylight and capturing the solar heat. During daytime hours,
daylight is a preferred source of light for many people and the proposal
directs the daylight deeper into a building. The daylight reflection system
provides a more sustainable approach by reducing the required electricity
and provides a more desirable quality of light.
