\noindent
Beyond normal academic office space and computer equipment, the 
specific requirement to carry out the proposed research is access to
suitable physical fabrication and testing facilities.

\subsection*{Laboratory}

This project will be conducted in the Stream Based Supercomputing
(SBS) laboratory, which has laboratory
facilities on the 5th floor of Jolley Hall,
and in the Graduate School of Architecture, which has laboratory
facilities in Givens and Steinberg Halls.
All of these facilities are on the Danforth
Campus of Washington University in St. Louis.

\subsection*{Office Space}

The Dept.\ of Computer Science and Engineering and the College of
Architecture provide office space to
all faculty, staff, postdocs, and graduate students.  The PIs have office
space in Jolley Hall and in Givens Hall.
while the graduate students will be housed in student offices
within Jolley Hall and Steinberg Hall.

\subsection*{Computer Equipment}

All computer equipment associated with the Dept.\ of Computer Science
and Engineering is supported by Engineering Information Technology
(EIT), an organization of the School of Engineering and Applied
Science.  The EIT staff includes full-time software system
administrators and hardware technicians.

\subsection*{Laboratory Equipment and Software}

The SBS laboratory has bench power supplies, oscilloscopes, logic
analyzers, multimeters, and function generators.  Available CAD
software includes Mentor Graphics FPGAdvantage, Synplicity Synplify
Pro, Xilinx ISE and Vivado Design Suite, Altera Quartus, Cadence,
HSPICE, Virtuoso, and Alegro.  For GPU operations, we have the latest
versions of the NVIDIA Linux kernel drivers and development toolkits.

\noindent
The Graduate School of Architecture has a full metalworking and woodworking
shop, including a number of 3D printers, an XYZ 3-axis CNC router,
and 4 CNC laser cutting machines.  Available software
includes Rhino3D and Grasshopper.

\subsection*{Specialized Equipment}

The Donald Danforth Plant Science Center has multiple greenhouses that
are suitable installation sites for our prototype catroptic system.
